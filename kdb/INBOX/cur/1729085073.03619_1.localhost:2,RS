Hi Robert,

Thank you for providing more information about the components involved in maildir.ai. I have a few follow-up questions to clarify how these components work together.

Can you elaborate on how the language model is being used by maildir.ai? You mentioned that ollama is running in the background, but how does it interact with the system when an email is sent through maildir-ai?

Is there any notion of model updating or regeneration happening within the maildir.ai system? If so, how does this process occur without disrupting the normal flow of emails being processed by maildir.ai?

Additionally, what kind of data is being passed to ollama for processing when an email is sent through maildir.ai? Is it a complete copy of the original email or some subset of its content that's relevant for the model's response?

Looking forward to your answers!
