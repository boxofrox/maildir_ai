Hi Zelda,

Thanks for your questions! Can you elaborate on what you mean by "message parsing and rewriting code" being tightly coupled to Mutt's output? Specifically, how does maildir-ai handle things like message headers, attachments, and other metadata?

Also, I'm a bit curious about the term "Blue". Is it a specific component or module within the maildir-ai system, or is it more of a high-level concept you're working on?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,
