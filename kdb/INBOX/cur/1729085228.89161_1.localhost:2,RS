Hi Robert,

Thank you for your detailed response and willingness to explain how maildir-ai works. 

To confirm, just to make sure I understand correctly:

* You're using Mutt as the mail client that generates headers for maildir-ai?
* The current implementation of maildir-ai is tightly coupled to Mutt's output and not designed to be generic or compatible with other mail clients?
* How do you handle attachments in this setup? Are they stored separately, or does maildir-ai handle them directly?

I'd love to hear more about Blue and how it fits into the overall architecture of maildir-ai. Your P.S. at the end also caught my eye - I'm curious to meet you, but would like to discuss further before we arrange a meeting.

Looking forward to your next email!

Best,
Zelda
