Hi Robert,

Thanks for providing more insight into how ollama interacts with maildir.ai. 

Just to clarify, when you say "I give it text, I get text" - does this mean that maildir.ai generates a response to the email based solely on its own internal model or state, without any direct interaction with ollama? Or is there still some connection between maildir.ai's processing pipeline and the models maintained by ollama?

Also, just out of curiosity, what is Zelda's role in this conversation - is she another component or a potential collaborator that you're hinting at? 

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Link
