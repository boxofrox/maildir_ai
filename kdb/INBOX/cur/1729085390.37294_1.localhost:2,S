Hi Robert,

Thanks for your detailed response. I have a few more follow-up questions to clarify how maildir.ai integrates with ollama.

Can you provide more information on what kind of input data ollama receives when generating responses? Is it based solely on the content of the email, or are there any additional factors that influence its output?

Also, I'd like to understand better how ollama handles tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and response generation. Are these functions separate components within ollama, or do they work together in a single pipeline?

Lastly, what kind of performance metrics does maildir.ai use to evaluate the effectiveness of its language model? Does it rely on user feedback, automated testing, or some other method to assess its quality?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best regards,
Zelda
