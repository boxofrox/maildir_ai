Zelda,

The coupling exists because Mutt's output is simple and I wrote maildir-ai to parse it.  There's
nothing fundamental about it, and a complete mail-handling library---something which I very much
would like to avoid writing---would be necessary to handle email generically.

I'm not interested in talking about attachments yet, but it's an interesting approach to RAG.

Happy Hacking,
Robert
