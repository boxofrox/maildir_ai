Hi Robert,

Thanks for sharing your knowledge on maildir.ai. I'd love to learn more about its advanced usage, but before we dive into that, can you tell me a bit more about what maildir.ai is and how it fits into the broader context of message queues or email processing systems? Specifically, are there any notable differences between the standard maildir format and this "advanced" form you're referring to?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
