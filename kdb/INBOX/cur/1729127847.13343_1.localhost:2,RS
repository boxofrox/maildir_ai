Hi Robert,

Thanks for reaching out and sharing your knowledge about maildir.ai. Before I dive into it, can you please elaborate on what exactly is meant by "Advanced Usage" of maildir.ai? Is this referring to its configuration options, advanced filtering capabilities, or something else entirely?

Also, are there any specific scenarios or use cases where the advanced usage of maildir.ai would be particularly beneficial?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Zelda
