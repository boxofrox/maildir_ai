Hey all,

I'm writing to let you know about how to use maildir.ai in the more
advanced form.  What I mean by advanced usage is abusing the limits of
email to get better brainstorming sessions against the AI.

I wrote maildir.ai for three reasons:

- I wanted to have a way to edit prompts and resubmit them using my
  favorite text editor.  While I can edit a file and pipe it to the
  prompt, I wanted a workflow that allows for structuring and recording
  the conversation.  This reminded me of threaded email in mutt.

  Consequently, I want an interface to LLMs that mimics mutt.

- I want a way to have the AI work in throughput-oriented modes.  If I
  can write emails faster than my non-GPU computer can answer them, I
  can queue up a bunch of emails and have the AI work on them in the
  background while I do other work.

- I have longed for a reason to use a maildir as a work queue.  There's
  nothing special here:  I use a standard implementation of maildir.

Advanced usage of maildir.ai consists of simply continuing a thread and
discarding all context, rewriting the message in its entirety.  This
essentially abuses the Reply-To feature of email to thread the history
of the conversation.  I also wanted the ability to backtrack and fork
ideas.  And I needed a way to prune bad responses.  In short, I wanted
mutt and rather than hack on mutt, I hacked on maildir.

Do you have any questions for me?

Happy Hacking,
Robert
