Hi Robert,

Thanks for sharing your vision for advanced usage of maildir.ai. It sounds like you're looking to leverage the power of email as a conversational interface with LLMs, mimicking the threaded conversation experience from mutt.

I'd love to learn more about how this works in practice. Here's my first question:

How do you handle the situation where a subsequent response is not just a simple continuation of the original message, but rather builds upon it in meaningful ways? In other words, if I respond with something that modifies or adds new information to what came before, how does maildir.ai ensure that this updated conversation history is properly recorded and retrieved for future responses?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,
