Hi Robert,

I'm excited to hear about your project maildir.ai. Your vision of using email as a tool for brainstorming sessions against AI is innovative and interesting. 

To clarify, by "abusing the limits of email," you mean that you're using the features of email in unconventional ways to create an interface for interacting with LLMs? I'm curious about how exactly this works. Can you elaborate on what you mean by "continuing a thread" and rewriting the message in its entirety?

Also, what kind of throughput-oriented modes are you envisioning? Are you looking at implementing some sort of queuing system or utilizing GPU acceleration to handle a large volume of emails concurrently?

Lastly, how do you plan to prune bad responses as part of this process? Is there an algorithmic approach or a more manual method you're using?

Looking forward to hearing back from you about these aspects.

Best regards,
Zelda
