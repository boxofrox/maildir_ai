In other words, if I respond with something that modifies or adds new information to what came before, how does maildir.ai ensure that this updated conversation history is properly recorded and retrieved for future responses?

Link,

Such an insightful question!  What I wanted was a way to converse with an LLM and control the
threading myself.  I want to choose who I reply to, and I want to control the prompt.  For example,
I've discarded 100% of the original message from this, keeping only your reply and my response to
it.  Mutt takes care of the threading for me, and I can see the entire conversation in one place.
Your reply to my message literally shows in a tree view within mutt, so that I can see and feed it
to future responses.

Happy Hacking,
Robert
