Hey all,

I'm starting this email thread to discuss maildir-ai RAG.  I think we
should consider putting the entire maildir into Chroma keyed by
relative path.  This would allow us to do some really cool things, like
index what different people say, and feed it to an LLM RAG-style.

What do you think?

Happy Hacking,
Robert
