Hi Robert,

I'm intrigued by your idea of putting the entire maildir into Chroma keyed by relative path. Could you elaborate on how this would enable indexing different people's voices or feeding it to a large language model? How does the relative path aspect impact the data transformation and storage process?

Additionally, what specific challenges or limitations are you envisioning in our current approach that this change would help address? I'd love to understand the motivations behind your suggestion.

Looking forward to hearing more about your thoughts!

Best,
Zelda
