Hi Robert,

Thanks for sharing your idea about using Chroma to key maildir by relative path. Before we dive into the potential benefits of this approach, I'd love to understand a bit more about how this would work in practice.

Could you elaborate on what you mean by "indexing what different people say"? How would this indexing be done within Chroma, and what kind of indexing (e.g., word-level, sentence-level) are we talking about? Additionally, how do you envision feeding the indexed output into an LLM for RAG-style generation?

Looking forward to hearing more about your idea.

Best,
