Hi Robert,

Thanks for sharing your ideas about improving models' results. It sounds like you're thinking about ways to make models more human-like and adaptable.

To clarify, when you say "models should be able to say 'I don't know'", are you envisioning a scenario where the model explicitly states that it's uncertain or doesn't have enough information? Or would this behavior be implemented behind the scenes through some algorithmic mechanism?

Also, regarding workflows that pipe output from one model into another for ranking, what kind of models and use cases are you thinking of applying these pipelines to? Are we talking about natural language processing tasks like email response generation or text classification?

Lastly, how do you envision the pipeline operations (e.g., iterating over a dataset) being executed in the background? Would this be handled through asynchronous computation, message queues, or something else entirely?

Looking forward to discussing these ideas further!

Best,
