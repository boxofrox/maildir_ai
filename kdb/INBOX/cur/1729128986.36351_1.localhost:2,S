Hi Robert,

Thanks for starting the thread. That's an interesting idea about models being able to say "I don't know" when they're unsure or need more information. Can you elaborate on how you envision this behavior manifesting in practice? For example, would it involve adding a new type of output that indicates uncertainty, or modifying existing models to incorporate some form of self-awareness?

Also, regarding the workflow pipeline idea, I'm curious about what kind of metadata or features you'd want these pipelines to include. Would they need to track things like which model was used for each operation, how many iterations were performed, and what metrics were being tracked? How would this information be passed between models in the pipeline?

Lastly, are there any specific concerns or challenges that you're aware of when it comes to implementing workflows with varying levels of uncertainty or iteration requirements? I'd love to hear about your thoughts on these topics.

Best,
Zelda
