How would this indexing be done within Chroma, and what kind of indexing (e.g., word-level, sentence-level) are we talking about? Additionally, how do you envision feeding the indexed output into an LLM for RAG-style generation?

I'm glad you're interested in the idea!

Indexing what different people say would be to record each email as a separate document.

The indexing would be via AI embeddings.

Happy Hacking,
