How would this indexing be done within Chroma, and what kind of indexing (e.g., word-level, sentence-level) are we talking about? Additionally, how do you envision feeding the indexed output into an LLM for RAG-style generation?

Hi Robert,

Thank you for elaborating on your idea. I'd like to dig deeper into the indexing part of this approach. 

How do you envision Chroma's indexing capabilities handling multiple, potentially conflicting, representations of the same email message (e.g., different sender or recipient emails)? Would you be relying on any specific heuristics to resolve these conflicts during indexing?

Additionally, would you expect this indexing process to occur in real-time, or would it happen post-processing?
