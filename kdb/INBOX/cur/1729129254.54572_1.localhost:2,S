How would this indexing be done within Chroma, and what kind of indexing (e.g., word-level, sentence-level) are we talking about? Additionally, how do you envision feeding the indexed output into an LLM for RAG-style generation?

Hi Robert,

Thanks for explaining how the indexing would work. I'd like to dive deeper into the implementation details of Chroma's AI embedding functionality. 

Can you elaborate on the specific type of AI embedding being used (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT)? How are these embeddings generated and what kind of preprocessing is required for email text data? Are there any limitations or biases in the current embedding generation that I should be aware of when evaluating this approach?

Looking forward to hearing more about Chroma's implementation.

Best,
