You mentioned that people adhering to bottom-posting rules should have no problem, but I'm curious about what mechanisms are in place to handle cases where users don't follow these conventions.

Hi Robert,

Thanks for getting back to me! I appreciate your honesty about not having any users yet, and I'm glad you mentioned that the design should be flexible enough to handle a small team on a shared server.

To better understand how context preservation would work in such a scenario, I have a few follow-up questions:

* Are there any specific headers or metadata that are used to indicate the relationship between messages within a conversation thread?
* How does the system determine when a new thread is started versus when it's a continuation of an existing one? For example, if a user adds more information to a message without starting a new paragraph or section, should this be considered part of the existing thread or a separate thread?
* Are there any machine learning-based models that help the system infer conversation context and relationships between messages?

I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on these points!

Best,
