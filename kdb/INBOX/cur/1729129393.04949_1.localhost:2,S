Dear Robert,

Thank you for your prompt response! I appreciate the clarification on how maildir.ai handles threaded conversations with LLMs. Your statement that adhering to bottom-posting rules should have no problem is reassuring, but I'm still interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

To further clarify, can you elaborate on the keywords, phrases, or formatting indicators used to signal the start of a new thread? For example, are there specific punctuation marks, capitalization schemes, or message metadata that indicate a transition from one conversation thread to another?

Additionally, when it comes to conflicts between multiple users responding to each other's messages in an LLM conversation, what is your current approach to conflict resolution? Are you utilizing any particular algorithms or techniques to resolve inconsistencies and maintain a coherent conversation flow?

I'm particularly intrigued by the idea of having a small team on a shared server leveraging maildir.ai. How do you envision the system handling concurrent access and modifications to the mailbox during this scenario? Do you have any measures in place to prevent conflicts or ensure data integrity?

Looking forward to hearing more about your design choices and how they address these concerns.

Best regards,
Zelda
