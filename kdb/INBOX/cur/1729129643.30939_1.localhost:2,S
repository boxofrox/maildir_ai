Hi Robert,

Thank you for answering my questions about your paper on improving model workflows. I have a few more follow-up questions based on your responses.

Firstly, regarding the implementation of models that can say "I don't know", do you envision the use of uncertainty quantification techniques such as Bayesian neural networks or Monte Carlo dropout to represent confidence levels? And how would you handle cases where the model is uncertain about its own uncertainty (i.e., the uncertainty becomes recursive)?

Additionally, I'd like to explore the pipeline operations further. You mentioned using a small state machine with a local key-value store. Could you elaborate on the benefits of using a local key-value store versus a distributed database or message queue system? And how would you ensure that the state machine remains consistent across multiple instances of the model or pipeline?

Lastly, I'm interested in learning more about the specific models and use cases you have in mind for applying these pipelines. Are there any particular applications or industries where you think these workflows could bring significant value (e.g., content moderation, customer service chatbots, etc.)?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,
Zelda
