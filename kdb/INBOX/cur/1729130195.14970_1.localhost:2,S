Hi Robert,

That sounds like an interesting project! I'm excited to learn more about maildir_ai and how it connects large language models via an email interface.

To clarify, when you say "maildir-ai watches a maildir directory for new messages", what kind of directories are we talking about? Are they standard Unix-style maildirs or something specific like IMAP folders?

Also, I noticed that the maintain process moves saved messages back to the INBOX when it begins processing the message. How does this work exactly? Is there some sort of signal or flag that tells maildir_ai to move the message to the INBOX after processing?

Lastly, what kind of language models are being used in maildir_ai? Are they specific models like transformer-based ones or more general-purpose models?

Looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best,
Zelda
